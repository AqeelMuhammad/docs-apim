# Creatio Connector¶

Creatio is a leading low-code platform for process management and customer relationship management (CRM). It is a cloud-based software that merges CRM features with business process management (BPM) capabilities. Creatio combines low-code CRM’s core modules (account and contact management, Salesforce automation, service management, marketing automation, document management, reporting, and analytics) with a business process management (BPM) engine. It can be delivered as a service (SaaS) or on-premise. Creatio enables a range of methods for integration with third-party software products. 

The Creatio Connector allows you to work with almost all the entities and functionalities of Creatio through REST interface, a web-based service that allows organisations to manage Customer Relationship Management (CRM) data while integration with external services/applications. You can use the Creatio connector to create, query, retrieve, update, and delete any of the objects that are exposed through the Creatio REST API layer by adding the authentication. It contains Contact, Case and Account mediators to manage CRUD operations through REST APIs.

To see the Creatio connector, navigate to the [connector store](https://store.wso2.com/store/assets/esbconnector/list) and search for "Creatio". **Creatio Connector** is the name of the connector that has this functionality.
