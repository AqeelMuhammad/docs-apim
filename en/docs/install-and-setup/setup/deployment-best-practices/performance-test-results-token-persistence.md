# Performance Test Results for Token Persistence


The token endpoint's performance was assessed in the WSO2 API Manager, both with and without token persistence. The tests were conducted with 100 concurrent users and 10 Developer Portal applications. Tokens were generated with device scopes to simulate high load, mimicking scenarios where thousands of tokens are generated within a short period of time. Tests covered Client Credentials, Passwords, and Refresh grant types.

A few key performace metrics were used to measure the performance of each grant type.

- Throughput: The number of tokens generated by the API-M key manager within a specific time frame (e.g., per second).
- APIM CPU Usage: CPU usage of the API Manager during tests. This metric is crucial as token generation and signing are CPU-intensive tasks.
- CPU and IOPS of the database: CPU usage and total I/O operations of the database during testing. This metric is vital in understanding how the database performance is affected when token persistence is removed.

**Key Observations**

- The throughput has gone down for both Client Credentials and Password grant types when token persistence is removed. This is because the available CPU for the API Manager instance has become a bottleneck instead of the database. The database used for testing is capable of handling a considerable load. This is evident from the results when tokens are persisted on the database. However, if the situation was reversed and the database became bottleneck, we would be able to see higher TPS results when token persistence is removed. Please refer the [Token Persistence Management]({{base_path}}/consume/token-management/token-persistence/#why-token-persistence-optimization) documenation to get more insights about the use cases in which this feature should be used.
- The Refresh grant has shown positive results when token persistence is removed. This means that the database which was a bottleneck to this flow previously is no longer a deciding factor as the tokens are not stored in the database. The numbers here can be further improved by scaling the API Manager instance.

!!! note
    The tests for Refresh grant were carried out by immediately regenerating a new access token using the refresh token, without waiting for the original token to expire.

The following graphs show the CPU usage of API Manager instance over time for different grant types.

The following graphs depict the variance of the CPU usage of the database over time for different grant types.

!!! note
    The above data clearly shows a significant reduction in database load (CPU and IOPS) for each grant type when token persistence optimization is enabled. In summary, enabling token persistence optimization can enhance system performance, especially in scenarios where the database is a limiting factor.
