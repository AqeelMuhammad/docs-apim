# B2B API Consumption

Prior to this release, WSO2 API Manager operates without a defined organizational structure, maintaining a flat hierarchy. This has resulted in limitations, including a lack of control over API visibility, business-specific subscriptions, and business-level insights. With the introduction of B2B features, you could have more structural behavour.

!!! note
    This release only provide support for organizatoin based restrictions to developer portal only.
